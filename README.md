# FAKE GOLF
Fake Golf is another version of Fake Sports. In Fake Golf, courses are designed by generating holes. Courses can then be used in tournaments, in which the Tournament Director picks numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) for each shot, while players attempt to guess those numbers. 1 and 1000 are connected, so no guess can have a difference of more than 500. The quality of a player's shot is determined by the difference. Players continue to guess until they reach the cup or swing a maximum number of shots for the hole. Scores for the holes are totaled for the round, and round scores are totaled for the tournament.

Development of the project will begin in late-Spring of 2024. You are welcome to join us at our Discord, where user testing will begin shortly thereafter: https://discord.gg/tC6D4nggJe
